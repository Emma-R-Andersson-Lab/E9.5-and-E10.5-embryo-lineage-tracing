# Ectoderm barcoding reveals neural and cochlear compartmentalization




# This repository contains instructions to

- Subset the neural and epithelial cells from parental object (All integrated from E9.5 & E10.5 collection in He et al. manuscript), UMAP with changed color in Fig1B, UMAP with cells highlighted in Fig1C  (Note book #1. E9E10_neural_and_epithelial_subset_Fig1.ipynb, as in Fig1).
- Visualization of highlight clone sharing (Notebook #2. Highlight clone sharing-Fig1D, E.ipynb, as in Fig1D,E)
- Subset epithelial cells and recluster. (Notebook #3. Subset epithelial cells_Fig2.ipynb, as in Fig 2)
- Visualization of upset plots and circos plots (Notebook #4. Upset plots and Circos plot-Fig1F, 2D, S2A)
